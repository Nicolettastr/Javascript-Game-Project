# javascript-game-project

One of my projects was a simple game that I created using JavaScript. The game featured a main character that had to touch a star in order to pass each level, with the ultimate goal being to reach the final level with the fastest time possible.

To create this game, I began by designing the layout and styling of the game using HTML and CSS. I then used JavaScript to create the game logic and functionality, including the movement of the character and the star, as well as the collision detection that determined whether the character had touched the star or any other obstacles.

I also added a timer to the game using JavaScript, which recorded the time it took for the player to complete each level and displayed it on the screen. If the player touched any obstacles other than the star, the game would reset and the player would have to start again.

Working on this project helped me to improve my skills in JavaScript, including working with functions, variables, and event listeners, as well as how to structure and organize my code to make it more manageable and maintainable over time. It also gave me experience working with HTML and CSS to create interactive applications and games.

Overall, I found this project to be a fun and challenging way to practice my skills in JavaScript and to explore the possibilities of creating engaging and interactive games using this powerful web technology.
